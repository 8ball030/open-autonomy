As we have discussed in earlier sections, agent services can execute arbitrary operations in a decentralized way.
There is a great deal of applications where the properties of agent services make them better suited than existing solutions,
especially in those cases where complex operations are required to be executed in a decentralized and transparent way.

* **Oracle services**: Traditional centralized oracles feeding information into a public ledger require strong trust assumptions on the oracle operator. In the majority of the cases, these operators are well-reputed, non-malicious providers. But still, there is no inherent crypto-native guarantee on their behaviour. An oracle service implemented as an agent service
does not require such strong trust assumptions.

* **Bridge components**:

* **Treasury management services**:
