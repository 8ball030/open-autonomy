{{open_autonomy}} is a framework for the creation of [agent services](./what_is_an_agent_service.md), and is realized on top of the {{open_aea}} framework.



Thus, the {{open_autonomy}} framework provides:

* A collection of **command line tools** to build, deploy, publish and test agent services.
* A collection of **packages with base classes** to create the necessary components that provide the underlying functionalities that AEAs need to become part of an agent service.

Throughout this documentation you will learn both how AEAs are extended to a service architecture, and how to use the framework to manage these services.
